## About the Project
This website acts as a one-stop solution for pet owners and shop managers alike. Customers can browse through a variety of pet-related products, place orders, book grooming or veterinary appointments, and leave product reviews. Meanwhile, administrators can efficiently manage inventory, view orders, and maintain the catalog through a user-friendly dashboard.
